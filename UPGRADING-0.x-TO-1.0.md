# Upgrading roboter from 0.x to 1.0

## System requirements

- roboter requires Node.js 8.0 or above.
- roboter works with macOS and Linux.
  - It has not been tested on Windows (it should basically work, but there is no guarantee).

## Installation

- Run `npm uninstall -g roboter-cli` to uninstall the globally installed `roboter-cli` package.
- Run `npm uninstall roboter-server` or `npm uninstall roboter-client` to uninstall the server- or client-side support packages from your module or application.
  - There is no distinction any more between using roboter for server-side and client-side code.
- Update `roboter` to `1.0.0` in your `package.json` file.
- Remove the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules` directory.
- Run `npm install`.

## Quick start

- Remove the `roboter.js` file from your module or application.
  - roboter tries to follow a zero-configuration approach.
  - Any configuration is done using default approaches, such as using `.babelrc`, `.eslintrc.json`, `mocha.opts`, â€¦
- Replace custom tasks with npm scripts.
  - Custom tasks have been removed.
  - For complex things consider creating a Node.js script that is run by an npm script.

## The `analyse` task

- Adjust what should be analysed using an [`.eslintignore`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#ignoring-files-and-directories) file.
- Use `analyse` to run the task.
  - The `analyze` alias has been removed.

## The `coverage` task

- Setup a custom solution for code coverage.
  - The `coverage` task has been removed.

## The `license` task

- License compatibility is now handled by roboter (but please note IANAL).
- To improve the license compatibility check [send a pull request](https://github.com/thenativeweb/roboter#the-license-task).
  - It is not possible any more to locally define license exceptions.

## The `outdated` task

- Run `npx roboter deps` instead.
  - The check for outdated dependencies is now part of the `deps` task.

## The `release` task

- Use `release` to run the task.
  - The `publish` alias has been removed.
- Use the `src` directory if you want to precompile your code.
  - This was previously provided using the `createDistribution` option.
- The distribution directory is hard-coded to `dist`.

## The `shell` task

- Replace shell tasks with npm scripts.
  - Shell tasks have been removed.
  - For complex things consider creating a Node.js script that is run by an npm script.






## The `test` task

This task runs your unit and integration tests.

To run this task continuously, you need to configure which files to watch. This usually is a combination of your test files and your actual source code.

```javascript
task('universal/test', {
  watch: [ '**/*.js', '!node_modules/**/*.js' ]
});
```

Then run the following command.

```shell
$ bot watch-test
```

### The `test-integration` task

This task runs integration tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), where the tests need to be written as asynchronous tests using the `tdd` style.

```javascript
suite('api', () => {
  test('runs on port 80.', done => {
    ...
    done();
  });  
});
```

By default roboter assumes that you store your integration tests in the `test/integration` directory of your project. However you can specify which files contain your integration tests. For that use the `src` parameter.

```javascript
task('universal/test-integration', {
  src: 'test/integration/**/*Tests.js'
});
```

To run this task use the following command.

```shell
$ bot test-integration
```

To run this task continuously, you need to configure which files to watch. This usually is a combination of your test files and your actual source code.

```javascript
task('universal/test-integration', {
  src: 'test/integration/**/*Tests.js',
  watch: [ '**/*.js', '!node_modules/**/*.js' ]
});
```

Then run the following command.

```shell
$ bot watch-test-integration
```

If you need to register any additional pre or post actions that shall be run before or after all tests, provide the files `test/integration/pre.js` and `test/integration/post.js` in your application. They need to export an asynchronous function, as in the following example.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = function (done) {
  // ...
  done(null);
};
```

In case something goes wrong, hand over the error to `done` instead of `null`.

If you need to configure where these files are located, use the `pre` and `post` properties.

```javascript
task('universal/test-integration', {
  src: 'test/integration/**/*Tests.js',
  pre: 'test/start-database.js',
  post: 'test/stop-database.js'
});
```

*Please note that the `post` task is always run, even in case of failing tests.*

### The `test-units` task

This task runs unit tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), where the tests need to be written as asynchronous tests using the `tdd` style.

```javascript
suite('Basic math', () => {
  test('1 plus 1 is 2.', done => {
    assert.that(1 + 1).is.equalTo(2);
    done();
  });  
});
```

You need to specify which files contain your tests. For that use the `src` parameter.

```javascript
task('universal/test-units', {
  src: 'test/units/**/*Tests.js'
});
```

To run this task use the following command.

```shell
$ bot test-units
```

To run this task continuously, you need to configure which files to watch. This usually is a combination of your test files and your actual source code.

```javascript
task('universal/test-units', {
  src: 'test/units/**/*Tests.js',
  watch: [ '**/*.js', '!node_modules/**/*.js' ]
});
```

Then run the following command.

```shell
$ bot watch-test-units
```

If you need to register any additional pre or post actions that shall be run before or after all tests, provide the files `test/units/pre.js` and `test/units/post.js` in your application. They need to export an asynchronous function, as in the following example.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = function (done) {
  // ...
  done(null);
};
```

In case something goes wrong, hand over the error to `done` instead of `null`.

If you need to configure where these files are located, use the `pre` and `post` properties.

```javascript
task('universal/test-units', {
  src: 'test/units/**/*Tests.js',
  pre: 'test/start-database.js',
  post: 'test/stop-database.js'
});
```

*Please note that the `post` task is always run, even in case of failing tests.*









## The `unused-dependencies` task

- Run `npx roboter deps` instead.
  - The check for unused and missing dependencies is now part of the `deps` task.
- The `exclude` property has been removed.

## The `update` task

- The `update` task has been removed.
  - Consider using tools such as [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) instead.

## The `build-client` task

- The `build-client` task has been removed.
  - Consider using solutions tailored specifically for your frontend stack instead.

## The `watch-client` task

- The `watch-client` task has been removed.
  - Consider using solutions tailored specifically for your frontend stack instead.

## The `build-server` task

- Run `npx roboter qa` instead.
  - The `build-server` task has been replaced by the `qa` task.

## The `watch-server` task

- Run `npx roboter test --watch` instead.
  - The `watch-server` task has been removed. The `test` task in watch mode is the closest equivalent.
